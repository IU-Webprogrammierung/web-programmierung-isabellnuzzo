      <h2 class="heading-secondary">About</h2>
      <p>
        The Idea behind the App Design WiseBloom was to
        <strong>combine efficiency with sustainability</strong>. The App merges
        productive task management with environmental impact - It allows users
        to stay organized while actively contributing to sustainability,
        regardless of their gardening expertise. It combines
        <em>three key features</em>;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Task Management and To-Do Lists</li>
        <li>Pomodoro Timer and Sustainable Rewards</li>
        <li>Group Collaboration for Enhanced Productivity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The interface is designed to feel warm, engaging and personal. All
        illustrations are <strong>hand-drawn by me</strong>, to achieve a
        <em>unique and organic touch</em> that aligns with the app's core values
        of creativity and sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining structured work techniques, collaborative engagement and
        tangible ecological impact, the app empowers users to create a more
        <strong>efficient and sustainable future.</strong>

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Staying focused and productive is challenging as is and traditional
        tools lack the right motivation. At the same time, many also want to
        contribute to sustainability with today's global warming rising by the
        day but they lack the time and resources. WiseBloom bridges this gap by
        combining productivity with real-world environmental impact.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Solution</h2>
      <p>
        WiseBloom transforms productivity into a purpose-driven experience. By
        integrating the <em>Pomodoro Technique</em> with real-world
        environmental action, the app not only keeps the users focused but also
        rewards their progress with tangible ecological impact. Every completed
        task contributes to planting trees and supporting pollinator-friendly
        initiatives, ensuring personal efficiency which will lead to a greener
        planet.

      <h1 class="heading-primary">Walkthrough.</h1>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Home<br />Page</h2>
      <p>
        The WiseBloom Home Screen provides a clear and structured overview of
        daily productivity and environmental contributions. At the top, users
        are shown their daily goals with the progress being tracked through
        checkboxes, which encourages focus and accountability. A weekly calendar
        highlights the <em>productivity milestones</em>, with the current day
        being prominently marked for easy navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task list section displays the projects that are currently active,
        in this case for example "App Design" or "Web Design", alongside
        progress indicators showing completed versus total tasks. Below, the
        rewards sections visually represent the user's environmental impact,
        such as the planting of flowers or trees, earned through completed
        goals. Users receive on top of that real-world updates, with photos
        documenting the implementation of their contributions, fostering
        motivation and transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        This
        <strong>interface embodies WiseBloom's mission:</strong> transforming
        productivity into meaningful action by blending task management with
        tangible ecological rewards.

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Lists</h2>
      <p>
        WiseBloom Lists Section streamlines task management with an
        <strong>intuitive and visually organized interface.</strong> Users can
        track progress through personalized messages, interactive checklists,
        and a progress chart for each list. Categories are color-coded for easy
        navigation, displaying completed versus total tasks at a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task creation feature allows users to <em>quickly</em> add tasks
        with a name, due date, description, and category, ensuring efficient
        organization. Designed for clarity and motivation, this section helps
        users stay productive and achieve their goals with ease.

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Studying</h2>
      <p>
        WiseBlooms Studying Screen integrates productivity with structure and
        motivation. This screen features the Pomodoro Timer, allowing users to
        focus on tasks like in this example "App Design" in timed intervals. A
        <strong>progress arc</strong> visually tracks time spent against the
        user's goal, while <strong>dynamic prompts</strong> encourage breaks,
        like a five-minute pause, to maintain productivity and balance.
        <em>Intuitive controls</em> —restart, pause, and stop— offer
        flexibility, while the dropdown menu allows users to switch between task
        lists seamlessly.

      <p>
        The WiseBloom Profile and Achievements Section highlights user progress
        and tangible contributions to environmental sustainability. In the
        profile view, users can see their personal details, total learning
        hours, and an overview of their achievements, including the number of
        flowers planted for pollinators, bee-friendly meadows created, and trees
        planted. This visual summary motivates continued engagement while
        celebrating environmental impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The achievements section expands on this, providing updates and evidence
        of real-world contributions. Users can explore detailed photo galleries
        showcasing flowers, meadows, and trees planted through their efforts.
        Each update includes dates, locations, and specific information, such as
        the planting of marigolds in the Black Forest and their importance to
        pollinators like bees and butterflies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cohesive system fosters transparency and motivation, ensuring users
        feel connected to the environmental impact of their productivity.
