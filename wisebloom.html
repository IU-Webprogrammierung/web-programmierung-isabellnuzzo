          <h2 class="heading-secondary">About</h2>
          <p>
            The Idea behind the App Design WiseBloom was to
            <strong>combine efficiency with sustainability</strong>. The App
            merges productive task management with environmental impact - It
            allows users to stay organized while actively contributing to
            sustainability, regardless of their gardening expertise. It combines
            <em>three key features</em>;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Task Management and To-Do Lists</li>
            <li>Pomodoro Timer and Sustainable Rewards</li>
            <li>Group Collaboration for Enhanced Productivity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The interface is designed to feel warm, engaging and personal. All
            illustrations are <strong>hand-drawn by me</strong>, to achieve a
            <em>unique and organic touch</em> that aligns with the app's core
            values of creativity and sustainability. By combining structured
            work techniques, collaborative engagement and tangible ecological
            impact, the app empowers users to create a more
            <strong>efficient and sustainable future.</strong>

        <h2 class="heading-secondary">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Staying focused and productive is challenging as is and traditional
          tools lack the right motivation. At the same time, many also want to
          contribute to sustainability with today's global warming rising by the
          day but they lack the time and resources. WiseBloom bridges this gap
          by combining productivity with real-world environmental impact.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-secondary">Solution</h2>
        <p>
          WiseBloom transforms productivity into a purpose-driven experience. By
          integrating the <em>Pomodoro Technique</em> with real-world
          environmental action, the app not only keeps the users focused but
          also rewards their progress with tangible ecological impact. Every
          completed task contributes to planting trees and supporting
          pollinator-friendly initiatives, ensuring personal efficiency which
          will lead to a greener planet.

            The WiseBloom Home Screen provides a clear and structured overview
            of daily productivity and environmental contributions. At the top,
            users are shown their daily goals with the progress being tracked
            through checkboxes, which encourages focus and accountability. A
            weekly calendar highlights the <em>productivity milestones</em>,
            with the current day being prominently marked for easy navigation.
            The task list section displays the projects that are currently
            active, in this case for example "App Design" or "Web Design",
            alongside progress indicators showing completed versus total tasks.
            Below, the rewards sections visually represent the user's
            environmental impact, such as the planting of flowers or trees,
            earned through completed goals. Users receive on top of that
            real-world updates, with photos documenting the implementation of
            their contributions, fostering motivation and transparency.

            WiseBlooms Studying Screen integrates productivity with structure

            <strong>progress arc</strong> visually tracks time spent against the
            user's goal, while <strong>dynamic prompts</strong> encourage
            breaks, like a five-minute pause, to maintain productivity and
            balance. <em>Intuitive controls</em> —restart, pause, and stop—
            offer flexibility, while the dropdown menu allows users to switch
            between task lists seamlessly.
