            <h2>Animated Album Cover</h2>

              <em>Visual Tribute to a Timeless Coming-of-Age Soundtrack</em>

            <p>
              This animated album cover is a <em>personal homage</em> to Kiki’s
              Delivery Service – Vocal Album (Yumi Arai / Joe Hisaishi, Studio
              Ghibli, 1989). Inspired by the album’s themes of independence,
              change, and growth, the scene uses
              <em>hand-drawn-style animation</em> and a pastel color palette to
              convey emotion and movement without words.

            At the center: a faceless scarecrow in an endless spring landscape,
            surrounded by swaying grass, surreal clouds, and a crow in flight.
            Every element loops seamlessly to reflect the idea of cyclical
            growth, leaving comfort, facing challenge, and returning
            transformed.

            Everything is hand-drawn in ProCreate and the animation was created
            entirely in Adobe After Effects. This piece challenged me to combine
            illustration, animation, and storytelling into a cohesive loop. It
            demonstrates my ability to develop concepts, work symbolically, and
            deliver polished motion design, even with no prior experience in the
            software.

            Every creative journey starts with a rough idea. This storyboard was
            my first step in translating a feeling into motion; a hand-drawn
            prototype that tested composition, rhythm, and narrative clarity
            before any animation began.
          </p>
          <p>
            These early frames explored how visual elements like the scarecrow,
            crow, and looping leaf might interact. I used this sequence to test
            out core timing, balance, and movement. Even at this early stage, I
            was thinking in loops: about cyclical growth, return, and subtle
            transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a static sketch soon evolved into a seamless animation
            with motion-tuned layers, atmospheric lighting, and refined
            character behaviors. Through iterative refinement and visual
            testing, I turned this static idea into a looping motion piece that
            now lives and breathes on screen.
