      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>
        LiveClass Munich is a web platform designed to promote student
        engagement and real-world exploration. By
        <strong>combining gamification and education</strong>, it encourages
        students to discover cultural and <em>hidden gems</em> in their city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key features include an interactive map with curated locations,
        customizable avatars, and QR-code-based quizzes that reward students
        with points. Students can collaborate by purchasing discounted class

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        In an era dominated by digital interactions, students are increasingly
        disconnected from real-world experiences and face challenges building
        meaningful connections outside the classroom. Traditional educational
        tools often lack the engagement and motivation needed to inspire
        exploration and teamwork. This leads to limited opportunities for
        students to connect with peers, discover cultural landmarks, and learn
        in an interactive, hands-on manner.
      </p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        LiveClass Munich reimagines education by transforming the city into an
        <strong>interactive classroom.</strong> Through an innovative blend of
        gamification and cultural discovery, the platform inspires students to
        engage beyond screens and traditional learning environments. With a
        dynamic map of Munich highlighting cultural landmarks, personalized
        avatars, and location-based QR-code challenges, LiveClass Munich turns
        exploration into a rewarding experience. Collaborative tools like
        discounted group tickets and a class-wide leaderboard foster teamwork
        and healthy competition, while the gamified structure ensures students
        remain motivated and engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution
        <em>seamlessly bridges education and real-world interaction</em>,
        offering an inspiring and modern approach to learning that builds
        connections, curiosity, and a deeper appreciation for the city's
        cultural fabric.
