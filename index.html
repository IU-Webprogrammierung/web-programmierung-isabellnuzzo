      <h2>
        Hello, I'm
        <p>Isabell Nuzzo</p>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am pursuing a degree in User Experience Design and am currently based
        in Munich, Germany. I bring my ideas to life through extensive research
        and hands-on experimentation with various media. I consider every
        perspective and ensure that all my skills contribute meaningfully to my
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for understanding how things work, combined with my problem
        solving abilities, makes me a reliable designer and developer. I quickly
        acquire new skills as needed - proven by this very website! Before
        creating this portfolio, I had minimal experience with coding, but I
        took a deep dive to bring it to completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I've piqued your interest, let's discuss how we can collaborate in
        the future!
