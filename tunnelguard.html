      </h3>

      <p>
        TunnelGuard is my latest project of 2025, designed to revolutionize
        tunnel monitoring and management systems with a user-centric, integrated
        approach. The software addresses critical shortcomings in existing
        systems, such as fragmented interfaces, lack of integration, outdated
        technology, and inefficient workflows, which hinder operators' ability
        to make quick and informed decisions during emergencies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Project Psychology</h2>
      <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Current tunnel monitoring systems are fragmented, outdated, and
        inefficient, posing significant challenges to operators during
        emergencies and day-to-day operations. These systems lack centralized
        integration, forcing operators to switch between multiple interfaces,
        which delays critical decision-making. Inadequate visualization of
        real-time data, limited automation, and outdated hardware further
        contribute to inefficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This disjointed setup results in increased error potential, slow
        response times, and challenges in coordinating actions during critical
        situations like fires, floods, or system malfunctions. Additionally,
        insufficient security measures and a lack of scalability hinder the
        ability to adapt to modern technologies and future infrastructure needs.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Solution</h3>
      <p>
        TunnelGuard offers a modern, centralized, and user-focused solution to
        revolutionize tunnel monitoring and management. The system introduces a
        revolutionary three-screen setup that ensures no critical data is ever
        out of the operator's field of vision. Each screen is dedicated to a
        specific function: the main dashboard for centralized controls, live
        video feeds for real-time monitoring, and a third screen for protocols
        and detailed data analysis. This design allows operators to access all
        necessary information simultaneously, eliminating the need for constant
        tab-switching and ensuring faster, more informed decision-making during
        emergencies and routine operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key features include real-time anomaly detection with visual alerts,
        automated emergency protocols, and flexible customization options to
        prioritize critical tasks. The systemâ€™s scalability ensures
        compatibility with new sensors and technologies, future-proofing the
        platform for evolving infrastructure needs. Advanced security measures
        protect against cyber threats, while the streamlined interface supports
        seamless navigation and improved usability.

      <p>
        The Login Screen for TunnelGuard has been designed to provide operators
        with a clear, secure, and intuitive access point to the system. The
        interface is divided into two sections: a visual placeholder on the
        left, allowing for branding or relevant imagery, and the functional
        login form on the right, ensuring a clean and focused layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key elements include fields for email and password, accompanied by
        options to remember login credentials and recover forgotten passwords,
        enhancing user convenience. A prominent "Sign in" button facilitates
        access, while a link below the form allows new users to sign up
        seamlessly. The minimalist design ensures a distraction-free experience,
        tailored for operators who require efficiency and simplicity.

      <p>
        The Dashboard Screen of TunnelGuard serves as the central hub for
        operators, providing a real-time overview of critical system data and
        controls. Designed for efficiency and clarity, the dashboard is divided
        into intuitive sections, enabling operators to monitor and manage
        multiple aspects of tunnel operations seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the left, a camera grid displays live video feeds from multiple
        tunnel cameras, with indicators showing the status and resolution of
        each feed. Operators can add or configure cameras and toggle between
        automatic and manual modes for greater flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The center panel features a task manager integrated with a calendar,
        allowing operators to track and prioritize urgent tasks, such as system
        monitoring and protocol reviews. Tasks are dynamically highlighted by
        urgency to ensure immediate attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the right, a detailed metrics panel provides key environmental data,
        including light intensity, smoke levels, CO2 measurements, and water
        levels. Operators can adjust settings like ventilation or water pumps
        through intuitive toggle switches, ensuring quick and effective
        responses to changing conditions.

      <p>
        The Analytics &amp; Traffic Screen of TunnelGuard provides a
        comprehensive overview of traffic flow and environmental conditions
        within and around the tunnel system. This screen is designed to enable
        operators to monitor real-time data, anticipate potential disruptions,
        and make informed decisions to ensure smooth traffic management and
        safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        The left panel features a traffic flow graph that combines vehicle
        volume and warning notifications over time, allowing operators to
        identify trends and potential bottlenecks. Below, a detailed weather
        forecast and its expected impact are displayed, showing metrics like
        humidity, precipitation, wind direction, and an energy balance graph for
        operational efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right panel focuses on real-time traffic updates, displaying current
        queue lengths and waiting times at tunnel portals. Alerts for scheduled
        closures or disruptions are clearly highlighted, ensuring proactive
        planning. Detailed graphs for the north and south portals visualize
        traffic conditions, and notifications of ongoing construction projects
        provide essential context for operational adjustments.

      />
      <p>
        The Protocols Screen of TunnelGuard provides operators with a
        centralized platform to manage and execute emergency and operational
        protocols efficiently. This screen is designed to ensure quick responses
        to critical incidents while maintaining a clear overview of ongoing
        tunnel activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The left panel highlights security alerts, listing actionable issues
        such as increased water levels, camera maintenance requirements, blocked
        emergency exits, and SOS notifications. Each alert includes a "show"
        option, enabling operators to access detailed information and take
        immediate action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below the alerts, a comprehensive list of predefined protocols is
        displayed, covering scenarios like fires, flooding, hazardous materials,
        power outages, traffic accidents, and evacuations. Operators can view,
        edit, or execute these protocols directly from the interface.
        Additionally, the system allows for the creation of new protocols,
        ensuring flexibility and adaptability for evolving needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the right, a live tunnel map provides a visual representation of the
        tunnel, showcasing the locations of phones, cameras, and other critical
        infrastructure. This ensures that operators can monitor and respond to
        incidents with precision.
