      <p>
        TunnelGuard is my latest project of 2025, designed to revolutionize
        tunnel monitoring and management systems with a user-centric, integrated
        approach. The software addresses critical shortcomings in existing
        systems, such as fragmented interfaces, lack of integration, outdated
        technology, and inefficient workflows, which hinder operators' ability
        to make quick and informed decisions during emergencies.

      <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Current tunnel monitoring systems are fragmented, outdated, and
        inefficient, posing significant challenges to operators during
        emergencies and day-to-day operations. These systems lack centralized
        integration, forcing operators to switch between multiple interfaces,
        which delays critical decision-making. Inadequate visualization of
        real-time data, limited automation, and outdated hardware further
        contribute to inefficiencies. This disjointed setup results in increased
        error potential, slow response times, and challenges in coordinating
        actions during critical situations like fires, floods, or system
        malfunctions. Additionally, insufficient security measures and a lack of
        scalability hinder the ability to adapt to modern technologies and
        future infrastructure needs.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Solution</h3>
      <p>
        TunnelGuard offers a modern, centralized, and user-focused solution to
        revolutionize tunnel monitoring and management. The system introduces a
        revolutionary three-screen setup that ensures no critical data is ever
        out of the operator's field of vision. Each screen is dedicated to a
        specific function: the main dashboard for centralized controls, live
        video feeds for real-time monitoring, and a third screen for protocols
        and detailed data analysis. This design allows operators to access all
        necessary information simultaneously, eliminating the need for constant
        tab-switching and ensuring faster, more informed decision-making during
        emergencies and routine operations. Key features include real-time
        anomaly detection with visual alerts, automated emergency protocols, and
        flexible customization options to prioritize critical tasks. The
        system's scalability ensures compatibility with new sensors and
        technologies, future-proofing the platform for evolving infrastructure
        needs. Advanced security measures protect against cyber threats, while
        the streamlined interface supports seamless navigation and improved
        usability.

            divided into intuitive sections, enabling operators to monitor and
            manage multiple aspects of tunnel operations seamlessly. On the
            left, a camera grid displays live video feeds from multiple tunnel
            cameras, with indicators showing the status and resolution of each
            feed. Operators can add or configure cameras and toggle between
            automatic and manual modes for greater flexibility. The center panel
            features a task manager integrated with a calendar, allowing
            operators to track and prioritize urgent tasks, such as system
            monitoring and protocol reviews. Tasks are dynamically highlighted
            by urgency to ensure immediate attention. On the right, a detailed
            metrics panel provides key environmental data, including light
            intensity, smoke levels, CO2 measurements, and water levels.

            enable operators to monitor real-time data, anticipate potential
            disruptions, and make informed decisions to ensure smooth traffic
            management and safety. The left panel features a traffic flow graph
            that combines vehicle volume and warning notifications over time,
            allowing operators to identify trends and potential bottlenecks.
            Below, a detailed weather forecast and its expected impact are
            displayed, showing metrics like humidity, precipitation, wind
            direction, and an energy balance graph for operational efficiency.
            The right panel focuses on real-time traffic updates, displaying
            current queue lengths and waiting times at tunnel portals. Alerts
            for scheduled closures or disruptions are clearly highlighted,
