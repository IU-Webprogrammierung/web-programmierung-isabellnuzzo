# Portfolio Project â€“ Web-Programming (DLBUXPWP01)

This repository contains my personal portfolio project developed as part of the IU International University course **"Web-Programming (DLBUXPWP01)"**.

## Project Concept

The core idea behind this project was to build a **static website** that presents myself, my background, and my selected design projects in a professional and engaging way. The focus was on delivering a **clear structure, appealing visuals, and technical precision** using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ without the use of frameworks.

The portfolio includes:

- A personalized **hero landing page** with an introduction and CV download
- An overview of my **skills, qualifications, and interests**
- Individual project pages for **TunnelGuard**, **Wisebloom**, and **Munich**
- A **contact section** with an accessible form
- A fully customized **404 error page**
- A **favicon** for branding consistency

The design is intended to appeal to potential employers and demonstrate my capability to combine **aesthetic design** with **solid technical execution**.

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Device                  | Screen Width     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Smartphones             | `â‰¤768px`         |
| Tablets & small laptops | `769px â€“ 1023px` |
| Desktops                | `â‰¥1024px`        |

### Approach

- I followed a **desktop-first strategy** to take full advantage of layout space and gradually adapted down for smaller devices.
- **Flexbox and Grid** were used to create flexible and well-aligned components across all screen sizes.
- Dedicated **`mobile.css`** and modular CSS files ensure each page adapts appropriately to its content and context.
- Special attention was given to readability, spacing, and tap targets on mobile devices.
